# Precision-Recall-Curve
Matlab code for computing and visualization:  Precision-Recall curve,  AUPR, Accuracy  etc. for Classification.


pr_curve.m: The codes for plotting the Precision-Recall-Curve and outputting the value of AUPR.



myACC.m: The codes for calcuating the values of ACC, PRE, SEN, F1_score, MCC under 5 different conditions.        
Note that 5 conditions including method = 'sp0.99' or 'sp0.95' or 'youden' or 'accMAX' or 'f1sMAX'. 
Usually we define method = 'sp0.99' or 'sp0.95'.
